# color-matching-clothes-ML
An ML algorithm that can detect the colors you are wearing and determine whether they match. If this repo is empty (it will remain this way until at least new years), it means I haven't gotten around to uploading the files yet. Sorry!

## Purpose

A lot of people tell me I have no sense of fashion, so I decided to try to remedy that by utilizing the power of my CPU! I am a noob in machine learning and the code is still unfinished (There is around 30% of code left), but I will continually update it with new features. Some future features include the ability to train it according to your subjective taste of fashion, which will then allow the algo to let you know whether what you're wearing looks nice or not, and the ability to catalog the items in your closet to allow it to recommend some items for you to wear if it deems your current clothes unsatisfactory. 

I am currently prototyping on a 1080p 30fps webcam using Python & OpenCV and I have no idea how it will respond to resolutions less/more than that. It is theoretically possible  to allow it to communicate with an Arduino or smartphone, which will afford you the luxury of not being confined to running it on your PC webcam. It can also help including an Arduino if you'd like to add some cool features like different colored LED's for yes/no. If you need help with setting this up, and I haven't uploaded Arduino files, don't hesitate to reach me on email! I'm not great at Arduino code but I offer what help I can.

It is planned that the code sends a reply of what it thinks of your clothes via a discord webhook but you can edit that and use whatever method you'd prefer (a text would be cool). The Discord bot is on another repo but I might include it here as well for continuity.

A complete documentation will be uploaded as soon as I have time.

## Disclaimer

If you decide to use this, you're welcome to do that as long as you give credit where credit is due. All code is built upon other code, and honestly, 99.9% of every line of code that you see in all of my repos can be attributed to incredible people at StackOverflow, Reddit, Discord, and Github. In the end, I can't stop you from not crediting me, but as with everything; Remember the human, be nice, and enjoy the code. :)
